# Main goal
</br>

For the purpose of this project, I've designed a full data application to help our company raise funds. Through the app, we're capable of determine what are the place to be, as a priority, to install or modernize drinking water acces infrastructures.
Our company is positioned on three core areas of expertise :
</br>
1. New sustainable drinking water access installations
2. Replace or/and secure old existing infrastructure if necessary
3. Sensibilise government to extend the coverage to acces of drinking water

# DataBase 
 
Data is official and comes from [Food and agriculture organization](https://www.fao.org/home/en). Small data quantity allow me to store them in Excel's data base.

There are 2 ways to launch the app : 
</br> 
1. *Editing mode :* launch Tableau desktop on your computer by running [Tableau desktop source file]() (Tableau Desktop last version is fully recommended)
