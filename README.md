# Main goal

For the purpose of this project, I've designed a full data application to help our company raise funds. Through the app, we're capable of determine what are the place to be, as a priority, to install or modernize drinking water acces infrastructures. Before going straight to the point, let me introduce you our company's DNA.  
So, it's important to know that our company is positioned on three core areas of expertise :
</br>
1. New sustainable drinking water access installations
2. Replace or/and secure old existing infrastructure if necessary
3. Educate government to extend the coverage to acces of drinking water


# DataBase 
 
Data is official and comes from [Food and agriculture organization](https://www.fao.org/home/en). Small data quantity allow me to store them in Excel's data base. 
</br>
To have a full access to Excel's data base, you can download the file BDD_DWFA [here](https://github.com/marcadeant/DWA/blob/main/Data%20Source/BDD_DWFA.xls) or in `Data source`'s directory

# Tableau software application

There are 2 possibles ways to launch the app : 
</br> 
1. **Editing mode :** launch Tableau desktop on your computer by download and running [Tableau desktop source file](https://github.com/marcadeant/DWA/blob/main/Application%20Tableau/Drinking%20Water%20Study.twbx) (Tableau Desktop last version is fully recommended)
2. **View/browsing mode :** Get a public access to the app from [Tableau public server](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/antoine.marcad./viz/DrinkingWaterStudy/Histoire1)
